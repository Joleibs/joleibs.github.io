			<div class = "col1"> When Donald Trump was elected president of the United States we all dealt with it differently. I dealt with it by writing a Chrome Extension that replaces the name "Donald Trump" with a slew of hilarious nicknames. It makes it really fun to read the news. While this project was not iterative and did not follow a design process in the traditional sense. I do feel it demonstrates my ability to prototype and execute my ideas. The plug-in is a simple and effective Javascript program. By bundling it with the vector Trump icon and UI I demonstrated my ability to follow through on my ideas and ship products. <br><br><b>Goal:</b> Create a Chrome Extension that would make reading news about Donald Trump more amusing. <br><br><b>Constraints:</b> Learning to use the Chrome Extension developer tools. <br><br><b>Outcome:</b> Hilarity. </div>
