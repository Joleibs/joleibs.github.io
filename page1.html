			<div class = "title2" > The Light Theremin (Physical Prototyping) </div>

			<p class = "text" class = "col1"> The Light Theremin was a simple concept. An interactive and intuitive lighting module that delightful to interact with. Read more about my process creating this object below. <br> <br> <b>Goals:</b> To create an interactive light source that is intuitive and delightful to interact with. <br> <br> <b>Constraints:</b> The ultrasound sensor's accuracy, debugging the Arduino, and finding a suitable power source. <br> <br> <b>Outcomes:</b> An intuitive physical object that combines elegant, simple design with interactive physical computing. </p>

			<p class = "col2 text" > <b>Arduino Build and Sensor:</b> The first step in bringing my vision to life was creating the internal component. I used an Arduino and ultrasound sensor to read and return the distance of an object. Next, I wrote a C++ program that would assign the color of a LED Strip light relative to the distance value. Through a period of trial and error, and some user testing, I honed in on the values that would return fluid color changes at distances that would be natural for a user to put his or her hand. Next, I need something to house my creation and tie my design together. </p>

			<div class = "col2 text"> <b>Casing Ideation:</b> To begin the creation of the exterior, I created a paper version of the object I had imagined. Using Rhino 3d to estimate the proper size of the pentagonal sides I came up with my first prototype iteration. I needed to consider several factors, including the overall size of the object, the size of the top hole (through which the ultrasound sensor points), and the distance from the internal ultrasound sensor to the top. Unfortunately, the first size I tried was much larger then I had imagined. To overcome this first roadblock, I created a second paper prototype about 80% the size of my first iteration.</div>

			<div class = "col text"> <b>Materials and Building:</b> After creating the digital design I needed to decide on material. My first thought was to make the design out of 3d printed acrylic. However, upon more research of translucency, accuracy, and overall aesthetic; I decided to make the object out of birch wood. This decision was the defining moment of the design of the exterior.The constraints of the wood led to the added benefits of hiding the Arduino build as well as adding an element of naturalism to the design, something I strive for in my projects. Using a laser cutter, I cut the wood pentagonal panels from larger pieces of birch plywood. </div>

			<div class = "col2 text"> <b>Execution and Use:</b> Finally, I combined the pentagonal panels of my casing using black zip ties. I put the internal mechanism inside the casing and set it in front of users. The outcome was ideal. The hole in the top of the design acts as an effective call to action for the user to put his or her hand over the top of the Theremin instantly changing the color of the light. Watching people explore and be delighted by my design was a truly amazing experience. Overall, I felt this project was a massive success and allowed me to practice my skills in iterative design, programming, physical computing, material sciences, and industrial design.
